    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to organize data for the Praxis Online application, focusing on doctor profiles, contact form submissions, and symptom checks. Each entity is stored in its own top-level collection for clarity and scalability. This structure facilitates straightforward security rules and queries.\n\n*   `doctor_profiles`: Stores doctor profiles. No specific authorization requirements are mentioned, implying open access or managed via backend.\n*   `contact_form_submissions`: Stores contact form submissions. Admin access is implied, so security rules should restrict write access.\n*   `symptom_checks`: Stores symptom check records. User-specific or open access, depending on requirements.\n\nThis design achieves authorization independence because there are no subcollections that inherit authorization context from their parent. Each collection is treated independently.\n\nQAPs are supported using segregation; each entity type has its own collection. The security rules will determine list access."
