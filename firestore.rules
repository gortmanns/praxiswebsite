/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for user profiles
 * and allows public read access for holidays, with owner-only writes.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores public user profile data, accessible only by the user themselves.
 * - /holidays/{holidayId}: Stores public holiday information, editable only by authenticated users.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own profile data.
 * - Holiday data is publicly readable but writable only by authenticated users.
 * - Data validation is minimal to allow for rapid prototyping. Only authorization-critical fields are validated.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - User profiles are stored under /users/{userId}, which allows using the `isOwner(userId)` function for simplified authorization.
 * - Holidays do not currently denormalize ownership, but the ruleset is prepared for this in the future (see TODO).
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - User profiles and holiday data are stored in separate collections based on access control needs.
