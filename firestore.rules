/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for the application.
 *
 * @core_philosophy This ruleset implements a role-based access control system with public read access for doctor profiles and admin-only access for contact form submissions.
 * @data_structure Doctor profiles are stored in a top-level collection `doctor_profiles`, accessible to all authenticated users. Contact form submissions are stored in `contact_form_submissions`, accessible only to users with an 'admin' role, determined by the existence of a document in `/roles_admin/{userId}`.
 * @key_security_decisions Doctor profiles are publicly readable, but all writes are restricted. Contact form submissions are completely restricted to admin users only. There is no user-owned data or listing of users. Admin status is determined by document existence in `/roles_admin/{userId}`.
