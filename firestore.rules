/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for Firestore.
 *
 * @Core Philosophy: This ruleset prioritizes ease of prototyping, focusing on secure access control without strict data validation. It assumes an eventual transition to more robust data validation.
 *
 * @Data Structure: The Firestore database contains a top-level `/doctors` collection.
 *
 * @Key Security Decisions:
 *   - All data in the `doctors` collection is considered publicly readable.
 *   - Doctor profiles can be created, updated, and deleted by authenticated users, however owner validation will be enforced based on matching ownership against the request.

     * @allow (get, list): Always allows reading doctor profiles.
     * @allow (create): Allows creating a doctor profile if the request is authenticated.
     * @allow (update, delete): Allows updating/deleting a doctor profile if the request is authenticated.
     * @deny (create, update, delete): Denies if the request is unauthenticated.
     * @principle Allows public read access while restricting write access to authenticated users.
