/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset secures the practice data stored in Firestore, including doctor profiles,
 * staff information, partner details, holiday schedules, and banner settings. It employs a strict
 * read-only policy for all data, ensuring that only authenticated users can access the information,
 * but does not restrict the data itself, in line with prototyping goals.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /doctors: Collection of doctor profiles.
 * - /staff: Collection of staff member profiles.
 * - /medicalPartners: Collection of medical partner information.
 * - /otherPartners: Collection of other partner information.
 * - /holidays: Collection of holiday periods.
 * - /settings/banners: Document containing all banner-related settings.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Read-Only Access: All collections are configured to allow read-only access (get, list) to any authenticated user.
 *   Write access (create, update, delete) is explicitly denied.
 * - No User-Specific Data: This ruleset assumes no user-specific data or ownership. If user-specific data is introduced,
 *   the rules will need to be modified to enforce ownership or role-based access control.
