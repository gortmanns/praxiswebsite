/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset adopts a public read-only model for all partner and staff/doctor listings,
 * meaning all `get` and `list` operations are allowed for all authenticated and unauthenticated users.
 * Write permissions (create, update, delete) are completely disabled in this prototyping phase,
 * which prioritizes a read-only configuration during initial development and testing.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The Firestore database consists of four top-level collections: `doctors`, `staff`, `medicalPartners`, and `otherPartners`.
 * Each collection stores documents representing entities of the corresponding type (e.g., Doctor, StaffMember).
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - All `list` and `get` operations are permitted for all users on all collections.
 * - All `create`, `update`, and `delete` operations are explicitly denied to ensure data integrity
 *   and prevent unauthorized modifications during the prototyping phase.
