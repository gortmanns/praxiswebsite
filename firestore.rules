/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the practice website.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset provides public read access to all collections and restricts write access.
 * No authentication or authorization is required to read data.
 * Write access is completely disabled as of now.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The Firestore database consists of several top-level collections:
 * - /doctors: Stores doctor profile information.
 * - /staff: Stores practice staff member profiles.
 * - /medicalPartners: Stores medical cooperation partner information.
 * - /otherPartners: Stores other cooperation partner information.
 * - /holidays: Stores practice holiday periods.
 * - /infoBanners: Stores multiple custom info banners (blue).
 * - /settings/banners: A single document that stores settings for holiday banners.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - All read operations (get, list) are public, requiring no authentication.
 * - All write operations (create, update, delete) are explicitly denied.
 * - Schema validation is not performed in this prototyping phase.
