/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the practice data model.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset is designed for the practice data model. It allows public read access for most content
 * but restricts write access to authenticated users. It follows a "Public Read with Owner-Only Writes" pattern
 * for the top-level collections, meaning any logged-in user can read data, but only authenticated users can create,
 * update, or delete it.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /doctors: Stores doctor profiles. Publicly readable.
 * - /staff: Stores staff member profiles. Publicly readable.
 * - /medicalPartners: Stores medical partner info. Publicly readable.
 * - /otherPartners: Stores other partner info. Publicly readable.
 * - /holidays: Stores practice holiday periods. Publicly readable.
 * - /settings/banners: Stores banner settings. Publicly readable.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public read access is granted to all collections.
 * - Write access is restricted to authenticated users only, acting as content owners.
 * - The `settings/banners` document is treated as a singleton and allows only authenticated user to write
 * - Listing of documents is enabled for all collections.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The current data model already includes `id` fields for all entities, which can be used for authorization by
 * comparing `request.auth.uid` to the document's `id` field.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * The data model uses top-level collections for all entities, with no user-specific subcollections.
