/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for user profiles,
 * allows public read access to holiday and doctor information, but restricts
 * write access to prevent unauthorized modifications.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile data, accessible only by the user themselves.
 * - /holidays/{holidayId}: Stores holiday information, publicly readable but not writable by clients.
 * - /doctors/{doctorId}: Stores doctor information, publicly readable but not writable by clients.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read and write their own profile data.
 * - Listing of users is disallowed to protect user privacy.
 * - Holidays and doctors collections are publicly readable to allow easy display of information,
 *   but write access is denied to clients.
