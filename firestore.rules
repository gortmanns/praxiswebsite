/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Praxis Online application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset provides basic security for the Praxis Online application.
 * Doctor profiles are publicly readable, while contact form submissions and symptom checks are restricted to prevent unauthorized access.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The data is organized into three top-level collections:
 *   - /doctor_profiles/{doctorProfileId}
 *   - /contact_form_submissions/{contactFormSubmissionId}
 *   - /symptom_checks/{symptomCheckId}
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Doctor profiles are publicly readable (get, list).
 * - Contact form submissions and symptom checks are not readable or writeable by default (admin access implied).
 * - No data validation is performed in this prototyping phase.
