/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the Praxis Online application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset provides open read access for doctor profiles while restricting write access to contact form submissions and symptom checks, defaulting to owner-only writes.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The database consists of three top-level collections: `doctor_profiles`, `contact_form_submissions`, and `symptom_checks`. Each collection stores data related to its respective entity.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Doctor profiles are publicly readable to allow easy access to doctor information.
 * - Contact form submissions and symptom checks are secured to prevent unauthorized modifications.
 * - Listing of collections is generally open for prototyping purposes, unless explicitly restricted.
 * - Data shape validation is minimized to enable rapid prototyping and iteration.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  N/A - Currently, there is no denormalization as each top-level collection is treated independently.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * Each entity type (DoctorProfile, ContactFormSubmission, SymptomCheck) has its own top-level collection, enabling independent security rules and easier data management.
