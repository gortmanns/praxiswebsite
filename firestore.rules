/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Praxis Online.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces role-based access control for contact form submissions and allows public read access for doctor profiles and symptom checks.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /doctor_profiles/{doctorProfileId}: Stores doctor profile information.
 * - /contact_form_submissions/{contactFormSubmissionId}: Stores contact form submissions.
 * - /symptom_checks/{symptomCheckId}: Stores symptom check records.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Doctor profiles are publicly readable.
 * - Contact form submissions are write-protected, intended for admin use only.
 * - Symptom checks are publicly readable.
