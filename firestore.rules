/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes data privacy and integrity by enforcing strict read/write access controls.
 * Data access is generally public for `get` and `list` operations, while data modification requires authentication.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The Firestore database consists of two top-level collections: `doctors` and `staff`.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public read access is allowed for both `doctors` and `staff` collections.
 * - Only authenticated users can create, update, or delete documents in these collections.
 * - No role-based access control is implemented at this stage. All authenticated users have equal modification rights.
