/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for user profiles
 * and allows public read access to holidays and doctors information.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores individual user profiles, accessible only to the user themselves.
 * - /holidays/{holidayId}: Stores holiday periods, publicly readable.
 * - /doctors/{doctorId}: Stores doctor information, publicly readable.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User profiles are private and only accessible to the owning user.
 * - Holidays and doctor information are considered public and can be read by anyone.
 * - No listing of user documents is allowed to prevent information disclosure.
