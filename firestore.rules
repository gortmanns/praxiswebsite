/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a public-read, admin-write model for doctors and holidays,
 * and a user-ownership model for user profiles.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores public user profile information, accessible only to the user themselves.
 * - /holidays/{holidayId}: Stores practice holiday periods, publicly readable but writeable by admins only.
 * - /doctors/{doctorId}: Stores doctor profiles for the team page, publicly readable but writeable by admins only.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Listing of users is disallowed.
 * - Public read access is granted for doctors and holidays, suitable for content intended for general consumption.
 * - Doctor and Holiday writes are not restricted to any particular role.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization: N/A. This ruleset does not currently require denormalization.
 * Structural Segregation: Public and private data is segregated into separate collections (users vs. doctors/holidays).
