/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles
 * and allows public read access to holiday information while restricting modifications to authenticated users.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information, accessible only by the user themselves.
 * - /holidays/{holidayId}: Stores public holiday information, write-protected.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User profiles are private and only accessible to the owning user. Listing of users is disallowed.
 * - Holidays are publicly readable but only modifiable by authenticated users.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization: N/A. The rules directly enforce ownership based on the `userId` path segment.
 * Structural Segregation: N/A.
