/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset defaults to public read access for all collections.
 * Write access to all collections is disallowed, as the application is read-only.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The Firestore database consists of several flat, top-level collections:
 * - /doctors: Stores doctor profiles.
 * - /staff: Stores staff member profiles.
 * - /medicalPartners: Stores medical partner information.
 * - /otherPartners: Stores other partner information.
 * - /holidays: Stores holiday periods.
 * - /infoBanners: Stores info banners.
 * - /settings/banners: Stores banner settings.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public Read Access: All collections are readable by any client, authenticated or not.
 * - No Write Access: No clients can create, update, or delete documents.
