/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for Prototyping
 *
 * @core_philosophy This ruleset prioritizes security by enforcing strict access controls.
 *  It assumes a public-read, owner-write model where appropriate, but defaults to denying access
 *  if the intent is unclear. It focuses on securing data based on user identity and relationships,
 *  deferring detailed schema validation for later iterations.
 *
 * @data_structure The Firestore database contains several top-level collections: `doctors`, `staff`,
 *  `medicalPartners`, `otherPartners`, `holidays`, and `settings/banners`.
 *  The `settings/banners` path contains a single document, while the other paths are collections.
 *
 * @key_security_decisions
 *  - Listing of `infoBanners` is explicitly denied due to the error report, as there's no clear owner or public read intent.
 *  - All write operations require authentication.
 *  - No data validation is performed beyond checking the authentication state.
 *  - Public read access is granted to `doctors`, `staff`, `medicalPartners`, `otherPartners`, and `holidays`.
