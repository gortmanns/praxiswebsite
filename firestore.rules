/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Praxis Online.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes a secure-by-default posture, focusing on explicit authorization for all write operations.
 * Read access is generally open unless specifically restricted.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The Firestore database consists of three top-level collections:
 * - /doctor_profiles/{doctorProfileId}: Stores public information about doctors.
 * - /contact_form_submissions/{contactFormSubmissionId}: Stores contact form submissions.
 * - /symptom_checks/{symptomCheckId}: Stores symptom check records.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Doctor profiles are publicly readable to facilitate discovery. Write access is restricted.
 * - Contact form submissions are publicly writable but should ideally be restricted to prevent spamming. In this prototyping phase, write access is open.
 * - Symptom checks are publicly readable and writable. In a production environment, you should restrict write access based on user authentication.
 * - No user listing is allowed to protect user privacy.
 * - Data shape validation is relaxed in this prototyping phase to allow for rapid iteration.
